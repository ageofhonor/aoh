If you are a member, you are expected to display these values, or face immediate disbandment.</DIV>');

		myFader1.addText('<DIV ALIGN=CENTER>PART 2[7]<BR/> Age Of Honor is a guild built on values for people in Everquest who seek a home with those who wish to be surrounded with a positive aura.  All Guilds have their disagreements, but our problems are expected to be solved swiftly, and sensibly. Any petty problems that arrise will be calmly	approached, and worked out in a civilized manner. I will not take care of them for you.  I am a guild leader , not a mommy.  I dont take sides, and I dont chose favorites, if it comes to bringing your petty disagreements to me to fix, I have the simplest solution for both parties.  Guildremove &lt;Target&gt;</DIV>');

		myFader1.addText('<DIV ALIGN=CENTER>PART 3[7]<BR/> Members of Age of Honor are to work for the good of the whole group.  Our strength lies in numbers, -much like an ant colony  to work towards  the goal  of  making us stronger and gaining knowledge of the game.  Age of Honor is a roleplaying guild, You are expected to roleplay the guildtag above your head.</DIV>');

		myFader1.addText('<DIV ALIGN=CENTER>PART 4[7]<BR/>  OFFICERS: Your rank is not just a title. It is a duty to our guild, if you cant handle the responsiblity, you will lose the rank.  Guildofficers are to be respected, but must also show the same respect to our members.  You are to be a shining beacon of what this guild represents.  I expect you to be at all guild functions that take place.  Nobody is above our code I listed above, especially you !!</DIV>');

		myFader1.addText('<DIV ALIGN=CENTER>PART 5[7]<BR/>  RAID EXPECTATIONS: I will not tolerate people not doing what they are told.  Orders are given to the raid parties for a reason.  Listen to them, agree with them, and follow them.  If you are on a raid with us, you are either following directions and helping the raid, or you are hurting us by doing whatever you want.  In the case of the second one, you will be told to leave raid and never attend another.  Raids are to go like this; get in, grab our loot, and leave as quickly and as efficiently as possible.</DIV>');

		myFader1.addText('<DIV ALIGN=CENTER>PART 6[7]<BR/> Some simple rules to follow: 1> ASSIST!! 2> ASSIST!! 3> Stay back out of the way for pullers. Do not agro mobs until they are pulled into camp. 4> Dont attack until  main assist calls target. I dont care if main assist is soloing it. Dont attack until target is called. 5> pets 95% of the time will not be allowed. 6> Casters ALWAYS nuke in melee range. Do not ping pong mobs between casters. Melee cant keep up and hurts chances of taunting mobs off of you. 7> Do not med during battle unless you are a enchanter or cleric and it is absolutely nesseccary.  Meditating = instant agro of mobs 8> ASSIST!!</DIV>');

		myFader1.addText('<DIV ALIGN=CENTER>PART 7[7]<BR/>  And finally, remember.  Everquest is a game.  Games are played for fun. Thes guildlines I believe, if followed, can make EQ alot of fun for all of us.  Welcome to Age of Honor. - Kirhouk Carnagequest, Guildleader<Age of Honor> Grave Lord</DIV>');
