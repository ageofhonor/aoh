I've returned to completing this website (22 years later - originally created in 2002) as a pet project, but mostly I'm hoping 
I can find some old friends to point here for a dose of nostalgia.

I've actually stumbled across a Reddit page in which Taimishu was
looking for his old crew - I hope you make it here sometime bud.

Finally completing the photo album was so much fun just to sift through the hundreds of old screenshots (that somehow 
survived all these years, including two server crashes).

If you're reading this - I'm glad you made it here! Please poke around and enjoy this memory of a wonderful snapshot in time.

Be well, and safe travels.
